# StackStorm in Docker containers

[![Circle CI Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/StackStorm/st2-docker/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/StackStorm/st2-docker)
[![Go to Docker Hub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker%20Hub-%E2%86%92-blue.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/stackstorm/stackstorm/)


## READ FIRST!!

- **Check the [CHANGELOG.rst](https://github.com/StackStorm/st2-docker/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst)** file for any potential
  changes that may require restarting containers.
- Be sure to use the latest `docker-compose.yml`. Run `git pull` in your `st2-docker` workspace!
- Run `st2ctl reload --register-all` to reload all services.


## TL;DR

```
make env
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec stackstorm bash
```

Open `https://localhost` in your browser. StackStorm Username/Password can be found in: `cat conf/stackstorm.env`

Running on Kubernetes? See [runtime/kubernetes-1ppc](./runtime/kubernetes-1ppc)


## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 1.13.0+


### Container configuration

The default container configuration is as follows:

 - stackstorm (st2 + st2web + st2mistral)
 - mongo
 - rabbitmq
 - postgres
 - redis


### Step by step instructions

We use Version 3 of the compose file format, so if you want to run docker-compose, you'll need to
ensure you're running Docker Engine release 1.13.0+.

First, execute

  ```
  make env
  ```

to create the environment files used by docker-compose. You may want to change the values of the
variables as necessary, but the defaults should be okay if you are not using any off-cluster
services (e.g. mongo, redis, postgres, rabbitmq).

NOTE: `make env` only needs to be run once.

As an example, if you want to change the username and password used by StackStorm, change the
`ST2_USER` and `ST2_PASSWORD` variables in `conf/stackstorm.env` prior to bringing up your docker
environment.

Second, start the docker environment. execute

  ```
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

This will pull the required images from docker hub, and then start them.

However, if you find need to modify the stackstorm image, you will need to build it. Run:

  ```
  REPO=stable
  docker build --build-arg ST2_REPO=${REPO} -t stackstorm/stackstorm:${REPO} images/stackstorm
  ```

where REPO is one of 'stable', 'unstable', 'staging-stable', 'staging-unstable'.  Otherwise,
the following `docker-compose` command will download the specified image from docker hub.

To stop the docker environment, run:

  ```
  docker-compose down
  ```


### Getting started: Simple Tutorial Tour

After you spin up the environment, you can play around with st2 *in container-ized environment* by following [this tutorial guide](./docs/tutorial.md).


## Data persistence

It's designed to suffice the ordinary use case by default. If you need to customize it, check below and modify `docker-compose.yml`

- The mongo, rabbitmq, postgres and redis containers store their data on persistent storage
- The stackstorm container persists the contents in following directories
    - `/var/log`
    - `/opt/stackstorm/packs`
    - `/opt/stackstorm/virtualenvs`
    - `/opt/stackstorm/configs`


## Environment variables

Below is the complete list of available options that can be used to customize your container.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `ST2_USER`     | StackStorm account username |
| `ST2_PASSWORD` | StackStorm account password |
| `MONGO_HOST` | MongoDB server hostname |
| `MONGO_PORT` | MongoDB server port (typically `27017`) |
| `MONGO_DB`   | *(Optional)* MongoDB dbname (will use `st2` if not specified) |
| `MONGO_USER` | *(Optional)* MongoDB username (will connect without credentials if this and `MONGO_PASS` are not specified) |
| `MONGO_PASS` | *(Optional)* MongoDB password |
| `RABBITMQ_HOST`         | RabbitMQ server hostname |
| `RABBITMQ_PORT`         | RabbitMQ server port (typically `5672`) |
| `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER` | RabbitMQ username |
| `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS` | RabbitMQ password |
| `POSTGRES_HOST`     | PostgreSQL server hostname |
| `POSTGRES_PORT`     | PostgreSQL server port (typically `5432`) |
| `POSTGRES_DB`       | PostgreSQL database |
| `POSTGRES_USER`     | PostgreSQL username |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | PostgreSQL password |
| `REDIS_HOST`     | Redis server hostname |
| `REDIS_PORT`     | Redis server port |
| `REDIS_PASSWORD` | *(Optional)* Redis password |


## Running custom shell scripts on boot

The `stackstorm` container supports running arbitrary shell scripts when the container launches:

* Scripts located in `/st2-docker/entrypoint.d` are executed before the init process starts any
stackstorm services.
* Scripts located in `/st2-docker/st2.d` are executed after stackstorm services are running.

NOTE: Only scripts with a suffix of `.sh` will be executed, and in alphabetical order of the file
name.

### /st2-docker/entrypoint.d

For example, if you want to modify `/etc/st2/st2.conf` to set `system_packs_base_path` parameter,
create `modify-st2-config.sh` with the follwing content:

  ```
  #/bin/bash
  crudini --set /etc/st2/st2.conf content system_packs_base_path /opt/stackstorm/custom_packs
  ```

Then bind mount it to `/st2-docker/entrypoint.d/modify-st2-config.sh`

- via `docker run`

  ```
  docker run -it -d --privileged \
    -v /path/to/modify-st2-config.sh:/st2-docker/entrypoint.d/modify-st2-config.sh \
    stackstorm/stackstorm:latest
  ```

- via `docker-compose.yml`

  ```
  services:
    stackstorm:
      image: stackstorm/stackstorm:${TAG:-latest}
       : (snip)
      volumes:
        - /path/to/modify-st2-config.sh:/st2-docker/entrypoint.d/modify-st2-config.sh
  ```

The above example shows just modifying st2 config but basically there is no limitation so you can
do almost anything.

You can also bind mount a specific directory to `/st2-docker/entrypoint.d` then place scripts as
much as you want.

### /st2-docker/st2.d

Scripts in this directory can be used to register packs, reload or restart services, etc.
You can bind mount these scripts as mentioned in the previous section.

NOTE: These scripts are currently not available when running in 1ppc mode.

## To enable chatops

Chatops is installed in the `stackstorm` image, but not started by default.

To enable chatops, delete the file `/etc/init/st2chatops.override` using a script in
`/st2-docker/entrypoint.d`.

  ```
  #!/bin/bash

  sudo rm /etc/init/st2chatops.override
  ```

You also need to configure it either

## packs.dev directory
- by passing all required parameters for st2chatops to the stackstorm container via environment variables
- by replacing `/opt/stackstorm/chatops/st2chatops.env` with the one that is properly configured. The easiest way is to use bind-mount.

By default, `./packs.dev` directory is bind-mounted to `/opt/stackstorm/packs.dev` in `stackstorm` container and registered as a secondary pack location. This is done by the startup script at [./runtime/entrypoint.d/add-packs-dev.sh](./runtime/entrypoint.d/add-packs-dev.sh)

This feature exists just for convenience, for testing and developing packs, and for [tutorial](./docs/tutorial.md). You can use it for arbitrary purpose, or ignore, or even disable it completely by removing corresponding entries and files.
Refer to the official StackStorm document for the list of available configuration parameters for `st2chatops`.

## Advanced: using 1ppc image

Official image now supports running in 1ppc mode: stands for *One Process Per Container*. Interested? Check [runtime/compose-1ppc](./runtime/compose-1ppc)

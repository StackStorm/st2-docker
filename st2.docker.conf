# /etc/st2/st2.docker.conf
#
# This st2.docker.conf overrides st2.conf in the base image, and has been written to facilitate operation of
# stackstorm-compose/docker-compose.yml. It is recommended to not alter this file as an end-user, as this file
# is updated as necessary by the StackStorm st2-dockerfile maintainers.  Instead, make local changes in the
# file "st2.user.conf".
# The order of merging: st2.conf < st2.docker.conf < st2.user.conf
